## What is a packet sniffer?

A packet analyzer or packet sniffer is a computer program, or computer hardware such as a packet capture appliance, which can intercept and log traffic that passes over a computer network or part of a network. Sniffers work by examining streams of data packets that flow between clients or server on a network. These packets are intended for — and addressed to — specific machines but using a packet sniffer in random mode allows IT professionals, end users or malicious intruders to examine any packet, regardless of destination.
